For my assignment I've included a Makefile and test file.
To run my code enter make and then ./my_malloc
Running the code yields several calls to my_mallinfo(), each with a number just above it.
Each call to my_mallinfo corresponds to a test. What the test is trying to accomplish is explained in a comment next to the call to my_mallinfo().
